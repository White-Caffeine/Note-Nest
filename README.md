**Problem Statement**
Existing note-taking applications suffered from a lack of organization and user-friendliness, hindering effective management of critical notes. Additionally, these platforms offered limited multimedia support, restricting users from embedding rich content such as images and hyperlinks. A uniform user experience further emphasized the need for personalization, allowing users to customize the aesthetics of their notes to align with their preferences. Moreover, optimization concerns were paramount, necessitating efficient storage and display mechanisms to conserve memory space and enhance overall performance.
